# Lost, Found or Adoptable
This project is intended to help the pet loving comunity that goes through that difficult moment of having a pet missing, or to help those warm hearted humans that found a pet wandering and are providing shelter while waiting for a human to claim the pet. And even help in the sad scenario when no human claimed the pet and it needs to be rehomed with a permanent family.

## First Release
First release will start with dogs.
